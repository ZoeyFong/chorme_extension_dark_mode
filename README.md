# Chrome Extension (MV3) Dark Mode Switcher

## Features

- This is a Chrome dark mode extension. It switches light / dark by `css3 filter`
- Can pre-check if a website is in the dark mode by default (implementing by itself), and skip it
- When switching buttons, the tabs of **same host** will be affected, and the affected tabs will be automatically updated when `onActivated`
